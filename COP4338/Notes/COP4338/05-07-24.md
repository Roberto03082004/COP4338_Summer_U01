Open terminal
username@ocelot.aul.fiu.edu
	-Default Passowrd:
		(firstnameinitial)(fiuPID)(lastnameinitial)
	-Changed Password:
		will prompt to make new password
* username@ocelot is the root directory
* ls = list all files
* Flag is a command to a units
	* ls is command to show file list
	* -l is a flag
	* everything after - is a flag
* flag -l shows file details (creation dates, file location etc.)
* clear to clear terminal/cmd
* to see hidden files use the flag ls -a
* to open file use cd (file directory)
* use cd .. to get to previous directory
* using tab will autofill the file directory
* how to see current directory use command pwd
* to create a new directory use mkdir (make directory) 
	* mkdir (foldername)
* ways to make file
	* touch first.txt
		* makes txt file
		* write in txt use
			* nano (filename)
		* in nano text editor ^ = hold control key
		* to see contents of file use
			* cat (directory)
	* you can also use nano first.txt
		* nano name.c to make a c file to edit using nano
* to copy a file use

#C
- use #include<> to import directory
	- most common directory is #include<stdio.h>
- void main (void)
- when submitting .c make sure the code is readable
	- must manually include tabs
- to run the code we first must compile the code into machine code
	- you must recompile every time you edit the code/file
- how to compile c program
	- use gcc filename
	- a new file will be made with a.out
		- this is the machine code that is executable
- to run the executable file use ./(filename)
	- ./a.out
- to make a new output file use
	- gcc (filename) -o (newoutputfilename)
	- gcc hello.c -o hello.out
	- ./hello.out to run the compiled code
